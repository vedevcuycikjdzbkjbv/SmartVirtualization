# Smart Virtualization for Android

## Description
An innovative Android application that enables resource sharing between mobile devices, effectively creating a virtual phone environment. This project aims to implement a mobile hypervisor that allows devices to share computational resources like RAM and processing power over a network connection.

## Key Features
- Device-to-device resource sharing capability
- Real-time resource monitoring and allocation
- Virtual environment management
- Network connectivity handling
- Resource optimization algorithms

## Technical Stack
- Android SDK
- Java/Kotlin
- Network protocols for device communication
- System-level resource management
- Custom virtualization implementation

## Current Status
This is a prototype implementation demonstrating the core concepts of mobile resource sharing and virtualization. The project is currently incomplete and under development. This prototype was developed with the assistance of Cursor AI to explore the possibilities of mobile resource virtualization.

## Future Roadmap
- Enhanced security protocols
- Improved resource allocation algorithms
- Multi-device support optimization
- User interface refinements
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Power consumption optimization

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle files
4. Run on Android device
